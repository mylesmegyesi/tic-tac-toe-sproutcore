### Tic-Tac-Toe ###

This is a small implementation of Tic-tac-toe written with the Sproutcore framework. The computer uses the Negamax algorithm to calculate it's moves. Go [here](http://mylesmegyesi.github.com/tic-tac-toe-sproutcore/static/tictactoe/en/1.2/) to check it out.  


If you are interested in diving into the code, some jumping off points might be,  
	* apps/tictactoe/controllers/game_controller.js -> This houses all the game logic.  
	* apps/tictactoe/models/board_model.js -> The houses all the logic for the board.  
	* apps/tictactoe/models/computer_model.js -> The houses all the logic for the computer AI i.e., the Negamax function.
